  <p>Welcome!</p>
  <p>I am Mengjie Zhao (赵 梦杰), and this website is used to record my ordinary life :-) Currently I am working as a doctoral student at the <a href="http://cis.lmu.de/ueber_uns/index.html">CIS</a>, where I spend most of my time trying to figure out some questions in NLP: </p>
  <ul> - What to embed  (characters, words, or character-ngrams) ?</ul>
  <ul> - What are embedded (semantics and syntactics) ?</ul>
  <p>Previously I received a M.Sc. from <a href="https://ic.epfl.ch/en">EPFL</a>, and a B.E. (Hons) from <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/">ANU</a>. I also enjoyed two great years staying at <a href="http://www.bit.edu.cn/">BIT</a>. </p>
